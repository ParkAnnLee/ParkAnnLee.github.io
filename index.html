<p>When a firm’s cash flows grow at a “constant” rate forever, the present value of those cash flows can be written as:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{Value} = \frac{\text{Expected Cash Flow Next Period}}{r - g}\)</span></p>
<p>where,</p>
<ul>
<li>r = Discount rate (Cost of Equity or Cost of Capital)</li>
<li>g = Expected growth rate</li>
</ul>
<p>The stable growth rate cannot exceed the growth rate of the economy but it can be set lower.</p>
<p>If you assume that the economy is composed of high growth and stable growth firms, the growth rate of the latter will probably be lower than the growth rate of the economy.</p>
<p>The stable growth rate can be negative. The terminal value will be lower and you are assuming that your firm will disappear over time.</p>
<p>If you use nominal cashflows and discount rates, the growth rate should be nominal in the currency in which the valuation is denominated.</p>
<p>One simple proxy for the nominal growth rate of the economy is the riskfree rate.</p>
<h2 id="risk-free-rates-and-nominal-gdp-growth">Risk free Rates and Nominal GDP Growth</h2>

</ul>

<h2 id="a-practical-reason-for-using-the-risk-free-rate-cap-preserve-consistency">A Practical Reason for using the Risk free Rate Cap – Preserve Consistency</h2>
<p>You are implicitly making assumptions about nominal growth in the economy, with your risk free rate. Thus, with a low risk free rate, you are assuming low nominal growth in the economy (with low inflation and low real growth) and with a high risk free rate, a high nominal growth rate in the economy.</p>
<p>If you make an explicit assumption about nominal growth in cash flows that is at odds with your implicit growth assumption in the denominator, you are being inconsistent and bias your valuations:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you assume high nominal growth in the economy, with a low risk free rate, you will over value businesses.</li>
<li>If you assume low nominal growth rate in the economy, with a high risk free rate, you will under value businesses.</li>

<p>While analysts routinely assume very long high growth periods (with substantial excess returns during the periods), the evidence suggests that they are much too optimistic. Most growth firms have difficulty sustaining their growth for long periods, especially while earning excess returns.</p>
<p>Recapping a key lesson about growth, it is not growth per se that creates value but growth with excess returns. For growth firms to continue to generate value creating growth, they have to be able to keep the competition at bay.</p>
<ul>
<li>Proposition 1: The stronger and more sustainable the competitive advantages, the longer a growth company can sustain “value creating” growth.</li>
<li>Proposition 2: Growth companies with strong and sustainable competitive advantages are rare.</li>

<h3 id="notes-by-prof.-damodaran">Notes by Prof. Damodaran</h3>
<p>Firms that grow for longer than 5 years are more the exception rather than the rule. We may be routinely over valuing growth companies as a consequence.</p>
<p>As a consequence, I use only three growth periods in my DCF valuations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Zero years, for firms that are already large and mature firms (Firms like Toyota and Exxon Mobil)</li>
<li>5 years for firms that still retain moderate growth potential or significant competitive advantages.</li>
<li>10 years for high growth firms.</li>
</ol>
<p>You do not want to value your firm to be the exception… That is asking for trouble..</p>
<h1 id="dont-forget-that-growth-has-to-be-earned">Don’t forget that growth has to be earned</h1>
<p>In the section on expected growth, we laid out the fundamental equation for growth:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{Growth Rate = Reinvestment Rate * Return on invested capital + Growth Rate from improved efficiency}\)</span></p>
<p>In stable growth, you cannot count on efficiency delivering growth and you have to reinvest to deliver the growth rate that you have forecast.</p>
<p>Consequently, your reinvestment rate in stable growth will be a function of your stable growth rate and what you believe the firm will earn as a return on capital in perpetuity:</p>
<p>Reinvestment Rate = Stable growth rate/ Stable period ROC = g/ ROC</p>
<p>Your terminal value equation can then be rewritten as:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{Terminal Value in year n} = \frac{EBIT_{n+1}(1−t)(1−\frac{g}{ROC})}{\text{Cost of Capital}−g}\)</span></p>

<p>Note that when the return on capital is equal to the cost of capital, the terminal value is invariant to growth. If it is set above the cost of capital, terminal value increases with growth and if set below, it decreases. The big assumption in your terminal value calculation in the one you make about excess returns in perpetuity, not the growth rate.</p>
<h2 id="excess-returns-to-zero">Excess Returns to Zero?</h2>
<p>There are some (McKinsey, for instance) who argue that the return on capital should always be equal to cost of capital in stable growth.<br>
But excess returns seem to persist for very long time periods.</p>
<p>There are some DCF practitioners who argue that the only excess return consistent with being a mature firm is zero. While that may make logical sense, it will then require you to forecast cash flows until excess returns become zero (rather than until the growth rate becomes stable).</p>
<p>In reality, firms that have earned excess returns in the past seem to have more success in holding on to excess returns. In other words, an assessment of strategic advantages and barriers to entry may be more relevant to good valuation than the focus on earnings growth.</p>
<p>Bottom line: If you adopt growth periods of 5 or 10 years, there are some firms with exceptional and sustainable competitive advantages that can sustain excess returns for far longer. For these firms, it is prudent to let the excess returns be positive in perpetuity (i.e., let the ROC in stable growth exceed the cost of capital). However, those excess returns should be moderate (my rule of thumb is to not let them exceed 2-3%.</p>
<h2 id="and-dont-fall-for-sleight-of-hand">And don’t fall for sleight of hand…</h2>
<p>A typical assumption in many DCF valuations, when it comes to stable growth, is that capital expenditures offset depreciation and there are no working capital needs. Stable growth firms, we are told, just have to make maintenance cap ex (replacing existing assets ) to deliver growth. If you make this assumption, what expected growth rate can you use in your terminal value computation?</p>
<p>What if the stable growth rate = inflation rate? Is it okay to make this assumption then?</p>
<p>The only growth rate that is consistent with this assumption is zero. Even if you set the growth rate = inflation rate, replacing existing assets will cost you more than the depreciation on those assets. Hence you will need to follow the equation on the last page to get to a reinvestment rate.</p>
<h1 id="be-internally-consistent">Be internally consistent</h1>
<p>Risk and costs of equity and capital: Stable growth firms tend to</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Have betas closer to one</li>
<li>Have debt ratios closer to industry averages (or mature company averages)</li>
<li>Country risk premiums (especially in emerging markets should evolve over time)</li>
</ol>
<p>The excess returns at stable growth firms should approach (or become) zero.<br>
ROC -&gt; Cost of capital and ROE -&gt; Cost of equity</p>
<p>The reinvestment needs and dividend payout ratios should reflect the lower growth and excess returns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stable period payout ratio = 1 - g/ ROE</li>
<li>Stable period reinvestment rate = g/ ROC</li>

            <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The basic “data type”, or a “variable” of a relational database, is a <strong>relation</strong>.<br>
In this unit, such a variable will be a <strong>set</strong>.<br>
Later, we will extend this, and such a variable will be a <strong>multiset</strong>.<br>
In SQL such a variable is called a <strong>table</strong>.<br>
We may use the term table for a relation in this unit too.</p>
<h1 id="sets">Sets</h1>
<p>We will not use axiomatic set theory.</p>
<p>A set is a “bag” of elements, some/all of which could be sets themselves and a binary relationship “is element of” denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\in\)</span>, such as 2 <span class="math inline">\(\in\)</span> {2, 5, 3, 7}, {2,8} <span class="math inline">\(\in\)</span> {2, {2, 8}, 5, 3, 7}.</p>
<p>You cannot specify</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How many times an element appears in a set (if you could, this would be a multiset)</li>
<li>In which position an element appears (if you could, this would be a sequence)</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, {2, 5, 3, 7} = {2, 7, 5, 3, 5, 3, 3}<br>
Note: in many places you will read: “an element can appear in a set at most once”</p>
<ul>
<li>This is not quite right. And it is important not to assume this, as we will see in a later unit</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="relations">Relations</h1>
<p>Consider a table, with a fixed number of columns where the elements of each column are drawn from some specific domain. The columns are labeled and the labels are distinct.</p>
<p>We will consider such a table to be <strong>a set of rows</strong> (another word for “row” in our context: <strong>tuple</strong>).</p>
<p>An example of a table S of two columns A and B</p>
<img src="/2019/03/19/Database-Systems-Unit-3/Relation_1.png">
<p>A <strong>relation</strong> is such a table<br>
We will also write S(A,B) for table S with columns A and B.</p>
<h2 id="relation-schema">Relation Schema</h2>
<p>What we saw was an <strong>instance</strong> (current value for a relation with the defined columns and domains).</p>
<p>To specify this relation in general (not the specific instance) we need to talk about a <strong>relational schema</strong>.<br>
A relational schema defines a set of relations.</p>
<p>In databases everything is finite, so a relational schema defines a finite set of finite relations.</p>
<p>Here is an informal, but complete, description what a relational schema of one relation is<br>
We want to define a structure for some table</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We give it a name (we had S)</li>
<li>We chose the number of columns (we had 2) and give them distinct names (we had A and B)</li>
<li>We decide on the domains of elements in the columns (we had letters for A and integers for B)</li>
<li>We decide on constraints, if any, on the permitted values (for example, we can assume as it was true for our example that any two rows that are equal on A must be equal on B)</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="keys">Keys</h1>
<p>We will specify generally, as suitable for the schema:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary keys</strong></li>
<li><strong>Keys</strong> (beyond primary)</li>
<li><strong>Foreign keys</strong> and what they reference (we will see soon what this means)</li>
</ul>
<p>The above are most important <strong>structurally</strong>. Later, especially when we talk about SQL DDL, we will specify additional properties and constraints. For example, the height of a person has to be positive, if it is known. Some of the constraints may involve more than one relation.</p>
<p>A set of columns in a relation is a <strong>superkey</strong> if and only any two tuples that are equal on the elements of these columns are (completely equal).<br>
<strong>A relation always has at least one superkey</strong><br>
The set of all the attributes is a superkey.<br>
A minimal superkey, is a <strong>key</strong>.<br>
A relation always has at least one key (start with any superkey and remove unnecessary columns)<br>
There may be more than one key <strong>Exactly one</strong> key is chosen as <strong>primary key</strong> (there is no formal way to decide which one)<br>
Other keys are just keys and sometimes they are called <strong>candidate keys</strong> (as they are candidates for the primary key, though not chosen)</p>
<h2 id="superkey">Superkey</h2>
<p>A set of columns whose values determine the values of all the columns in a row for every instance of the relation</p>
<ul>
<li>All the columns form a superkey (trivially)</li>
<li>Superkeys are only used in formal definitions</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="key">Key</h2>
<p>A set of columns whose values determine the values of all the columns in a row for every instance of the relation, <strong>but any proper subset of that set of columns does not do that</strong></p>
<h2 id="primary-key">Primary Key</h2>
<p>A chosen key. Important: <strong>no attribute of a primary key can be NULL</strong> (the value of every attribute must be always known); why will be discussed later</p>
<h1 id="relational-databases">Relational Databases</h1>
<p>A relational database is “basically” a set of tables with values drawn from specified domains, specified using a relational schema.</p>
<p>This is formally correct, but it is misleading in reality As we will see soon, a better way to define a relational database is to say that it is</p>
<ul>
<li>A set of relations</li>
<li>A set of binary, many-to-one mappings between them (partial functions), mimicking child-to-parent relationships Looking from the “other side,” they are one-to-many, mimicking parent-to-child relationships</li>
<li>Some other, less fundamental, components ignored for now</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="from-er-diagram-to-relational-database-key-concepts-with-examples">From ER Diagram to Relational Database: Key Concepts With Examples</h1>
<p>We are now ready to convert ER diagrams into relational databases<br>
Generally, but not always</p>
<ul>
<li>An entity set is converted into a table</li>
<li>A relationship is converted into a table</li>
<li>This is logical design, though some call it physical design</li>
</ul>

            <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="purpose-of-er-model">Purpose of ER Model</h2>
<p><strong>Entity/relationship (ER) model</strong> provides a common, informal, and convenient method for communication between application and users/customers and the database designers in order to model the information's structure.</p>
<p>This is <strong>conceptual design</strong>, though some call this <strong>logical design</strong>.</p>
<p>The ER model typically employs <strong>ER diagrams</strong>, pictorial descriptions to visualize information's structure.</p>
<p>ER models are well-suited for database designs and are both <strong>simple</strong> and <strong>powerful</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Whatever needs to be specified about the application that cannot be specified using ER diagrams needs to be stateds as textual comments.</strong></p>
<p>There are three basic concepts appearing in the original ER model, which has since been extended. We will present the model from more simple to more complex concepts, with examples on the way.</p>
<p>We will go beyond the original ER model, and cover most of the Enhanced ER model.</p>
<p>While the ER model’s concepts are standard, there are several varieties of pictorial representations of ER diagrams.</p>
<ul>
<li>We will focus on one of them: Chen’s notation</li>
<li>We will also cover Crow’s foot notation, which is particularly suited for relational database design</li>
<li>Others are simple variations, so if we understand the above, we can easily understand all of them.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can look at some examples at: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity-relationship_model" class="uri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity-relationship_model</a></p>
<h2 id="basic-concepts">Basic Concepts</h2>
<p>The three basic concepts are:</p>
<h3 id="entity">Entity</h3>
<p>This is an “object.” Cannot be defined even close to a formal way. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bob</li>
<li>Boston</li>
<li>The country whose capital is Paris<br>
(There is only one such country so it is completely specified)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="relationship">Relationship</h3>
<p>Entities participate in relationships with each other. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alice and Boston are in relationship Likes (Alice likes Boston)</li>
<li>Bob and Atlanta are not in this relationship</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="attribute-property">Attribute (property)</h3>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Age is an attribute of persons</li>
<li>Size is an attribute of cities</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="entity-1">Entity</h1>
<p>Entity is a “thing” that is distinguished from others in our application</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: Alice</li>
</ul>
<p>All entities of the same “type” form an entity set; we use the term “type” informally</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: Person (actually a set of persons). Alice is an entity in this entity set</li>
</ul>
<p>What type is a little tricky sometimes Example. Do we partition people by sex or not?</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes makes sense: gave birth This allows better enforcement of constraints. You could “automatically” make sure that only entities in the set of (biological) women, but not in the set of men can give birth</li>
<li>Sometimes maybe not: employment</li>
</ul>
<p>Example. When we say “the set of all Boeing airplanes,” is this</p>
<ul>
<li>The set of all models appearing in Boeing’s catalog (abstract objects), or</li>
<li>The set of airplanes that Boeing manufactured (concrete objects)?</li>
</ul>
<p>We may be interested in both and have two entity sets that are appropriately related.</p>
<p>We will frequently use the term “entity” while actually referring to entity sets, unless this causes confusion.</p>
<p>Pictorially, an entity set is denoted by a <strong>rectangle</strong> with its type written inside.</p>
<p>By convention, singular noun, though we may not adhere to this convention if not adhering to it makes things clearer.</p>
<p>By convention capitalized or all capitals if acronym.</p>
<h2 id="strong-and-weak-entities">Strong and Weak Entities</h2>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>strong entity</strong> (set): Its elements can be identified by the values of their attributes, that is, it has a (primary) key made of its attributes</li>
<li>A <strong>weak entity</strong> (set): Its elements cannot be identified by the values of their attributes: no primary key can be made from its own attributes Such entities can be identified by a combination of their attributes and the relationship they have with an entity in another entity set</li>
</ul>
<p>We assume that women are given SSNs. Men are not given SSNs; they have first names only, but for each we know who the mother is (that is, we know the SSN of the man’s mother).</p>
<p>Man is a <strong>weak</strong> entity as we cannot identify a specific man based on his own attributes and this is indicated by <strong>thick lines</strong> around it.</p>
<p>Many women could have a son named Bob, so there are many men named Bob. However, if a woman never gives a specific name to more than one of her sons, a man can be identified by his name (note <strong>double underline</strong>) and by his mother’s SSN.</p>
<img src="/2019/03/18/Database-Systems-Unit-2/Entity_1.png">
<p>Assuming that a woman does not have more than one son with a specific first name.</p>
<p>Name becomes a <strong>discriminant</strong>.</p>
<p>Man can be identified by the combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Woman to whom he is related under the Son relation. This is indicated by thick lines around Son (it is weak). Thick line connecting Man to Son indicates the relationship is total on Man (every Man participates) and used for identification</li>
<li>We add an arrowhead for consistency, although we know that semantically the relationship must be many-to-one</li>
<li>His Name. His Name is now a <strong>discriminant</strong>; this is indicated by <strong>double underline</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We need to specify for a weak entity through which relationship it is identified; this is done by using <strong>thick lines</strong>.</p>
<p>Otherwise we do not know whether Man is identified through Son or through Works.</p>
<img src="/2019/03/18/Database-Systems-Unit-2/Entity_2.png">
<p>Sometimes a discriminant is not needed. We are only interested in men who happen to be first sons of women. Every Woman has at most one First Son.</p>
<p>So we do not need to have Name for Man (if we do not want to store it, but if we do store it, it is not a discriminant).</p>
<p>Note an arrowhead to the left: each Woman has at most one First Son.</p>
<img src="/2019/03/18/Database-Systems-Unit-2/Entity_3.png">
<p>In general, more than one attribute may be needed as a discriminant.</p>
<p>For example, let us say that man has both first name and middle name.</p>
<ul>
<li>A mother may give two sons the same first name or the same middle name</li>
<li>A mother will never give two sons the same first name and the same middle name</li>
</ul>
<p>The pair (first name, middle name) together form a discriminant.</p>
<p>There can be several levels of “weakness”.</p>
<p>Here we can say that a horse named “Speedy” belongs to Bob, whose mother is a woman with SSN 072-45-9867.</p>
<p>A woman can have several sons, each of whom can have several horses.</p>
<img src="/2019/03/18/Database-Systems-Unit-2/Entity_4.png">
<h2 id="weak-entity-or-multivalued-attribute">Weak Entity or Multivalued Attribute?</h2>
<p>If nothing in the description of the application leads us to believe that Man could have its own attributes or could participate in relationships (other than with his mother), it might be more natural to implement the fragment of the database using a multivalued attribute.</p>
<h1 id="attribute">Attribute</h1>
<p>An entity may have (and in general has) a set of zero or more attributes, which are some properties.</p>
<p>Each attribute is drawn from some domain (such as integers) possibly augmented by NULL (more about NULLs later).</p>
<p>All the entities in an entity set have the same set of attributes, though not generally with the same values.</p>
<p>Attributes of an entity are written in ellipses (for now solid lines) connected to the entity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: FN: “First Name.” LN: “Last Name.” DOB: “Date of Birth.”</li>
</ul>
<img src="/2019/03/18/Database-Systems-Unit-2/Attribute_1.png">
<p>Attributes can be</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Base</strong> (such as DOB) or <strong>derived</strong> denoted by <code>dashed ellipses</code> (such as Age, derived from DOB and the current date)</li>
<li><strong>Simple</strong> (such as DOB) or <strong>composite</strong> having their component attributes <code>attached</code> to them (such as Address, when we think of it explicitly as consisting of street and number and restricting ourselves to one city only)</li>
<li><strong>Singlevalued</strong> (such as DOB) or <strong>multivalued</strong> with unspecified in advance number of values denoted by <code>thick-lined ellipses</code> (such as Child; a person may have any number of children; we do not consider children as persons in this example, this means that they are not elements of the entity set Person, just attributes of the entities in this set)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people (not we) use the convention of using double lines whenever we use thick lines</p>
<img src="/2019/03/18/Database-Systems-Unit-2/Attribute_2.png">
<p>To have a simple example of a person with attributes</p>
<ul>
<li>Child: Bob</li>
<li>Child: Carol</li>
<li>FN: Alice</li>
<li>LN: Xie</li>
<li>DOB: 1980-01-01</li>
<li>Address.Number: 100</li>
<li>Address.Street: Mercer</li>
<li>Age: Current Date minus DOB specified in years (rounded down)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="keys">Keys</h1>
<p>Most of the times, some subset (proper or not) of the attributes of an entity has the property that <em>two different entities in an entity set must differ on the values of these attributes</em>.</p>
<p>This must hold for all conceivable entities in our database Such a set of attributes is called a <strong>superkey</strong> (“weak” superset of a key: either proper superset or equal).</p>
<p>A minimal <strong>superkey</strong> is called a <strong>key</strong> (sometimes called a candidate key).</p>
<ul>
<li>This means that no proper subset of it is itself a superkey.</li>
</ul>
<p>Informally: superkey values can identify an individual entity but there may be unnecessary attributes</p>
<p>Informally: key value can identify an individual entity but there are no unnecessary attributes</p>
<p>Example: Social Security Number + Last Name form a superkey, which is not a key as Social Security Number is enough to identify a person</p>
<p>In our example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Longitude and Latitude (their values) identify (at most) one City, but only Longitude or only Latitude do not</li>
<li>(Longitude, Latitude) form a superkey, which is also a key</li>
<li>(Longitude, Latitude, Size, Name) form a superkey, which is not a key, because Size and Name are superfluous</li>
<li>(Country, State, Name) form another key (and also a superkey, as every key is a superkey)</li>
</ul>
<p>For simplicity, we assume that every country is divided into states and within a state the city name is unique</p>
<h2 id="primary-keys">Primary Keys</h2>
<p>If an entity set has one or more keys, one of them (no formal rule which one) is chosen as the <strong>primary key</strong>.</p>
<p>In SQL <strong>the other keys</strong>, loosely speaking, are referred to using the keyword <code>UNIQUE</code></p>
<p>In the ER diagram, the attributes of the primary key are <strong>underlined</strong></p>
<p>So in our example, one of the two below:</p>
<img src="/2019/03/18/Database-Systems-Unit-2/Keys_1.png">
<h1 id="relationship-1">Relationship</h1>
<p>Several entity sets (one or more) can participate in a <strong>relationship</strong>.</p>
<p>Relationships are denoted by diamonds, to which the participating entities are “attached”.</p>
<p>A relationship could be binary, ternary, ….</p>
<p>By convention, a capitalized verb in third person singular (e.g., Likes), though we may not adhere to this convention if not adhering to it makes things clearer.</p>
<h2 id="isa">ISA</h2>
<h3 id="the-isa-relationship">The ISA Relationship</h3>
<p>For certain purposes, we consider subsets of an entity set. The subset relationship between the set and its subset is called <strong>ISA</strong>, meaning <strong>“is a”</strong>.</p>
<p>Elements of the subset, of course, have all the attributes and relationships as the elements of the set: they are in the “original” entity set.</p>
<p>In addition, they may participate in relationships and have attributes that make sense for them.</p>
<p>But those relationships and attributes do not make sense for every entity in the “original” entity set.</p>
<p>ISA is indicated by a triangle. The elements of the subset are weak entities, as we will note next.</p>
<p>Example: A subset that has an attribute that the original set does not have</p>
<p>We look at all the persons associated with a university Some of the persons happen to be professors and some of the persons happen to be students</p>
<img src="/2019/03/18/Database-Systems-Unit-2/ISA_1.png">
<p><strong>It Is Possible to Represent Hierarchies Using Weak Entities, but not a good idea.</strong></p>
<img src="/2019/03/18/Database-Systems-Unit-2/ISA_2.png">
<p>Professor is a weak entity because it cannot be identified by its own attributes (here: Salary).</p>
<p>Student is a weak entity because it cannot be identified by its own attributes (here: GPA).</p>
<p>They <strong>do not</strong> have <strong>discriminants</strong>, they are identified by the primary key of the strong entity (Person).</p>
<p>We <strong>do not</strong> need to put Student and Professor in a rectangle with <strong>thick lines</strong> as being “under” ISA automatically tells us that they are weak entities.</p>
<p>There may be an attribute of Person (called <strong>discriminator</strong>) that can be used to determine who is a Student and who is a Professor.</p>
<ul>
<li>For a fake example: Professor names start with a A–M and Student names start with N–Z (but note advisement in our department for a real example)</li>
</ul>
<p>The set and the subsets are sometimes referred to as <strong>class</strong> and <strong>subclasses</strong>.</p>
<p>A person associated with the university (and therefore in our database) can be in general</p>
<ul>
<li>Only a professor</li>
<li>Only a student</li>
<li>Both a professor and a student</li>
<li>Neither a professor nor a student</li>
</ul>
<p>A specific ISA could be</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disjoint</strong>: no entity could be in more than one subclass</li>
<li><strong>Overlapping</strong>: an entity could be in more than one subclass</li>
<li><strong>Total</strong> (also called Complete): every entity has to be in at least one subclass</li>
<li><strong>Partial</strong>: an entity does not have to be in any subclass</li>
</ul>
<p>This could be specified by replacing “ISA” in the diagram by an appropriate letter.</p>
<p>If nothing stated, then no restriction, so effectively O,P.</p>
<p>ISA is really a superclass/subclass relationship.</p>
<p>ISA could be <strong>specialization</strong>: subsets are made out of the “more basic” set.</p>
<p>ISA could be <strong>generalization</strong>: a superset is made of “more basic” sets.</p>
<p>Again, the diagram could be annotated to indicate this</p>
<h3 id="a-more-complex-example">A more complex example</h3>
<p>We have several types of employees</p>
<ul>
<li>Managers</li>
<li>Programmers</li>
<li>Analysts</li>
<li>Other</li>
</ul>
<p>An employee can be one of the following</p>
<ul>
<li>Manager</li>
<li>Programmer and/or Analyst</li>
<li>Other</li>
</ul>
<p>The 3 sets are disjoint, that is</p>
<ul>
<li>Manager cannot be Programmer or Analyst, or Other</li>
<li>Other cannot be Manager, Programmer, or Analyst</li>
</ul>
<p>All Employees have some share properties<br>
It is convenient to group Programmers and Analysts together as they have some shared properties</p>

            <h2 id="the-value-of-growth">The Value of Growth</h2>
<p>When valuing a company, it is easy to get caught up in the details of estimating growth and start viewing growth as a “good”, i.e., that higher growth translates into higher value.</p>
<p>Growth, though, is a double-edged sword.</p>
<ul>
<li>The good side of growth is that it pushes up revenues and operating income, perhaps at different rates (depending on how margins evolve over time).</li>
<li>The bad side of growth is that you have to set aside money to reinvest to create that growth.</li>
<li>The net effect of growth is whether the good outweighs the bad.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ways-of-estimating-growth-in-earnings">Ways of Estimating Growth in Earnings</h2>
<h3 id="look-at-the-past">Look at the past</h3>
<p>The historical growth in earnings per share is usually a good starting point for growth estimation</p>
<h3 id="look-at-what-others-are-estimating">Look at what others are estimating</h3>
<p>Analysts estimate growth in earnings per share for many firms. It is useful to know what their estimates are.</p>
<h3 id="look-at-fundamentals">Look at fundamentals</h3>
<p>Ultimately, all growth in earnings can be traced to two fundamentals - how much the firm is investing in new projects, and what returns these projects are making for the firm.</p>
<h1 id="growth-i-historical-growth">Growth I: Historical Growth</h1>
<p>Historical growth rates can be estimated in a number of different ways</p>
<ul>
<li>Arithmetic versus Geometric Averages</li>
<li>Simple versus Regression Models</li>
</ul>
<p>Historical growth rates can be sensitive to</p>
<ul>
<li>The period used in the estimation (starting and ending points)</li>
<li>The metric that the growth is estimated in</li>
</ul>
<p>In using historical growth rates, you have to wrestle with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to deal with negative earnings</li>
<li>The effects of scaling up</li>
</ul>

<p>You are trying to estimate the growth rate in earnings per share at Time Warner from 1996 to 1997. In 1996, the earnings per share was a deficit of <code>$0.05</code>. In 1997, the expected earnings per share is <code>$0.25</code>. What is the growth rate?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>-600%</li>
<li>+600%</li>
<li>+120%</li>
<li>Cannot be estimated</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="dealing-with-negative-earnings">Dealing with Negative Earnings</h2>
<p>When the earnings in the starting period are negative, the growth rate cannot be estimated. (0.30/-0.05 = -600%)</p>
<p>There are three solutions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Use the higher of the two numbers as the denominator (0.30/0.25 = 120%)</li>
<li>Use the absolute value of earnings in the starting period as the denominator (0.30/0.05=600%)</li>
<li>Use a linear regression model and divide the coefficient by the average earnings.</li>
</ol>
<p>When earnings are negative, the growth rate is meaningless. Thus, while the growth rate can be estimated, it does not tell you much about the future.</p>

<h2 id="update-earnings">Update Earnings</h2>
<p>When valuing companies, we often depend upon financial statements for inputs on earnings and assets. Annual reports are often outdated and can be updated by using-</p>
<ul>
<li>Trailing 12-month data, constructed from quarterly earnings reports.</li>
<li>Informal and unofficial news reports, if quarterly reports are unavailable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Updating makes the most difference for smaller and more volatile firms, as well as for firms that have undergone significant restructuring.</p>
<p><strong>Time saver</strong>: To get a trailing 12-month number, all you need is one 10K and one 10Q (example third quarter). Use the Year to date numbers from the 10Q. For example, to get trailing revenues from a third quarter 10Q:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{Trailing 12-month Revenue} = \text{Revenues (in last 10K)} - \text{Revenues from first 3 quarters of last year} + \\ \text{Revenues from first 3 quarters of this year}\)</span></p>
<h2 id="correct-accounting-earnings">Correct Accounting Earnings</h2>
<p>Make sure that there are no <strong>financial expenses</strong> mixed in with operating expenses</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial expense: Any commitment that is <strong>tax deductible</strong> that you have to meet no matter what your operating results: Failure to meet it leads to loss of control of the business.</li>
<li>Example: Operating Leases: While accounting convention treats operating leases as operating expenses, they are really financial expenses and need to be reclassified as such. This has no effect on equity earnings but does change the operating earnings</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure that there are no <strong>capital expenses</strong> mixed in with the operating expenses</p>
<ul>
<li>Capital expense: Any expense that is expected to generate <strong>benefits over multiple periods</strong>.</li>
<li>R&amp;D Adjustment: Since R&amp;D is a capital expenditure (rather than an operating expense), the operating income has to be adjusted to reflect its treatment.</li>

<p>Operating Lease Expenses are treated as operating expenses in computing operating income. In reality, operating lease expenses should be treated as financing expenses, with the following adjustments to earnings and capital:</p>
<p>Debt Value of Operating Leases = Present value of Operating Lease Commitments at the pre-tax cost of debt</p>
<p>When you convert operating leases into debt, you also create an asset to counter it of exactly the same value.</p>
<p>Adjusted Operating Earnings</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\text{Adjusted Operating Earnings} = \text{Operating Earnings} + \text{Operating Lease Expenses} - \\ \text{Depreciation on Leased Asset}\)</span></li>

<h2 id="accounting-malfeasance">Accounting Malfeasance</h2>
<p>Though all firms may be governed by the same accounting standards, the fidelity that they show to these standards can vary. More aggressive firms will show higher earnings than more conservative firms.</p>
<p>While you will not be able to catch outright fraud, you should look for warning signals in financial statements and correct for them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Income from unspecified sources - holdings in other businesses that are not revealed or from special purpose entities.</li>
<li>Income from asset sales or financial transactions (for a non-financial firm)</li>
<li>Sudden changes in standard expense items - a big drop in S,G &amp;A or R&amp;D expenses as a percent of revenues, for instance.</li>
<li>Frequent accounting restatements</li>
<li>Accrual earnings that run ahead of cash earnings consistently</li>
<li>Big differences between tax income and reported income</li>

<p>To decide what to do when your firm is losing money, you first have to diagnose the problem. If the problem is transitory (a recession, a loss caused by a strike), you can normalize earnings instantaneously and use the normalized earnings in valuation.</p>
<ul>
<li>If it is <strong>long term</strong>, you have to first figure out what the long term problem is.</li>
<li>If it is <strong>financial</strong> - the firm has too much debt - you have to consider whether the firm can pay down its debt and survive. If you believe it can, lower the debt ratio each year and compute a cost of capital.</li>
<li>If it is <strong>operating</strong> or <strong>strategic</strong> - you have to work out what it will cost the firm to fix these problems- and build the expected improvement in margins over time.</li>
<li>If it is <strong>life cycle</strong> related - the firm is in early stage of its life cycle and it is normal to lose money at that stage - you have to build in the expectations of the improvements that will occur as the firm moves up the life cycle (with a healthy dose of skepticism about whether the firm will make it).</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="cash-flows-ii-taxes-and-reinvestment">Cash Flows II: Taxes and Reinvestment</h1>
<h2 id="what-tax-rate">What tax rate?</h2>
<p>The tax rate that you should use in computing the after-tax operating income should be</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The effective tax rate in the financial statements (taxes paid/Taxable income)</li>
<li>The tax rate based upon taxes paid and EBIT (taxes paid/EBIT)</li>
<li>The marginal tax rate for the country in which the company operates</li>
<li>The weighted average marginal tax rate across the countries in which the company operates</li>
<li>None of the above</li>
<li>Any of the above, as long as you compute your after-tax cost of debt using the same tax rate</li>
</ol>
<p>The effective tax rate is defined as taxes paid/ taxable income, as defined in the reporting books. The marginal tax rate is the tax rate on the last dollar of income. The effective tax rate is lower than the marginal tax rate for most firms. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>Bracket creep: Can be a reason for small private businesses but not for large publicly traded firms where most of the income is at the highest marginal tax rate anyway.</li>
<li>Cosmetic factors: Two sets of books with different accounting standards for tax and reporting books.</li>
<li>Real factors: Capacity to defer taxes to the future.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-right-tax-rate-to-use">The Right Tax Rate to Use</h2>
<p>The choice really is between the effective and the marginal tax rate. In doing projections, it is far safer to use the marginal tax rate since the effective tax rate is really a reflection of the difference between the accounting and the tax books.</p>
<p>By using the marginal tax rate, we tend to understate the after-tax operating income in the earlier years, but the after-tax tax operating income is more accurate in later years.</p>
<p>If you choose to use the effective tax rate, adjust the tax rate towards the marginal tax rate over time.</p>
<ul>
<li>While an argument can be made for using a weighted average marginal tax rate, it is safest to use the marginal tax rate of the country</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a choice, you would prefer to do valuation with the tax books in front of you, but since you do not have that choice as an outsider you have to choose between the effective tax rate and the marginal tax rate.</p>
<p>If you use the effective tax rate all the way through, you are assuming that taxes can be deferred forever. This is unrealistic - tax deferrals catch up with you as your growth flags - and will result in an overvaluation of your firm.</p>
<p>If you use a marginal tax rate, you are assuming that you cannot defer taxes from this point on. This is far too conservative and will yield too low a value for your firm.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestion</strong>: Start with the effective tax rate in the early years and move towards the marginal tax rate in the terminal year.</p>

<p>The discount rate should be consistent with both the riskness and the type of cash flows being discounted.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Equity verus Firm</strong>: If FCFE, then use cost of equity. IF FCFF, then use cost of capital.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Currency</strong>: Cash flows in different currencies shall have different discount rates.</li>
<li><strong>Nomial versus Real</strong>: Nomial cash flows -&gt; nomial rates. Real cash flows -&gt; real rates.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="types-of-risks">Types of Risks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Estimation VS Economic uncertainty
<ul>
<li>Estimation uncertainty reflects the possibility of having the wrong models or wrong inputs in the model.</li>
<li>Economic uncertainty originates from the fact that markets and economies can change over time and models (even the best) will fail to capture the unexpected changes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Micro VS Macro uncertainty
<ul>
<li>Micro uncertainty refers to the uncertainty about a single frim, e.g. the potential markets for its products, the comptetion, the management, etc.</li>
<li>Macro uncertainty refers to the uncertainty of the whole market that the firm can be affected by the changes in the macro economic environment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Discrete VS Continuous uncertainty
<ul>
<li>Discrete risk lies dormant for periods but show up at points in time. For example, a drug working its way through the FDA pipeline may fail at some stage of approval process.</li>
<li>Continuous risk are risks that changes in interest rates or economic growth occur continuously and affect value as they happen.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-role-of-the-marginal-investor">The Role of the Marginal Investor</h3>
<h4 id="not-all-risk-counts">Not all risk counts</h4>
<p>The sense that cost of equity should be higher for riskier investments and lower for safer investments is intuitive. But what risk should be built into it?</p>
<h4 id="risk-through-whose-eyes">Risk through whose eyes?</h4>
<p>While risk is usually defined in terms of the variance of actual returns around an expected return, risk and retur nmodels in finance assume that the risk to be rewarded is hte risk perceived by the margianl investor in the investment.</p>
<h4 id="the-diversification-effect">The diversification effect</h4>
<p>Most risk and return models in finance also assume that the marginal investor is well diversified, and that the only risk that he perceives in an investment is the risk that cannot be diverisified away, a.k.a market or non-diversifiable risk. In effect, it is primarily economic, macro, continuous risk that should be incorporated into the cost of equity.</p>

<ul>
<li>A risk free rate as a base</li>

<h2 id="discount-rate-i-the-riskfree-rate">Discount Rate I: The Riskfree Rate</h2>
<p>On a riskfree investment, the actural return is equal to the expected return. Therefore, there is no variance around the expected return.</p>
<p>For an investment to be risk free, it has to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>No default risk</li>
<li>No reinvestment risk</li>
</ul>
<p>It follows then that if asked to estimate a risk free rate:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Timeline matters</strong>: The risk free rates will depend on when the cash flow is expected to occur and will vary across time. (1yr, 2yrs, 10yrs will generate different rates)</li>
<li><strong>Currency matters</strong>: A risk free rate is currency-specific and can be different for different currencies.</li>
<li><strong>Not all government securites are risk free</strong>: Some governments face default risk so the rates on the bonds issued are not risk free.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="three-ways-to-sovereign-default-spread">Three Ways to Sovereign Default Spread</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Sovereign dollar/euro denomiated bonds</strong>: Find soverign bonds denomiated in US dollars issued by an emerging sovereign.
<ul>
<li>Default spread = Emerging Government Bond Rate (in US $) - US Treasury Bond Rate with the same maturity</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>CDS spreads</strong>: Obtain the trated value for a sovereign Credit Default Swap (CDS) for the emerging government.
<ul>
<li>Defalut spread = Sovereign CDS spread (with perhaps adjustment for CDS market frictions)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sovereign-rating bashed spread</strong>: Average of the spread for other countries with the same sovereign rating.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="example">Example</h4>
<p>The Brazilian government bond rate in nominal reais on January 1, 2019 was 9.18%. To get to a riskfree rate in nominal reais, we can use one of three approaches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Approach 1: Government Bond spread
<ul>
<li>The 2023 Brazil bond, denominated in US dollars, has a spread of 1.30% over the US treasury bond rate.</li>
<li>Riskfree rate in $R = 9.18% - 1.30% = 7.88%</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Approach 2: The CDS Spread
<ul>
<li>The CDS spread for Brazil, adjusted for the US CDS spread was 2.57%.</li>
<li>Riskfree rate in $R = 9.18% - 2.57% = 6.61%</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Approach 3: The Rating based spread
<ul>
<li>Brazil has a Ba2 local currency rating from Moody’s. The default spread for that rating is 3.39%</li>
<li>Riskfree rate in $R = 9.18% - 3.39% = 5.79%</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="alternative-approach">Alternative Approach</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Build up approach: The risk free rate in any country can be written as the sum of two variables: <span class="math display">\[\text{Risk free rate} = \text{Expected Inflation in currency} + \text{Expected real interest rate}\]</span> The expected real interest rate can be computed in two ways:
<ol type="1">
<li>US TIPs</li>
<li>Real growth in the economy Thus, if the expected inflation rate in a country is 15% and the TIPs rate is 1%, the risk free rate is 16%.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>US rate &amp; Differential Inflation: Alternatively, you can scale up the US risk free rate by the differential inflation between the US and the currency in question <span class="math display">\[\text{Riskfree Rate}_{Currency} = (1 + \text{Riskfree Rate}_{US\$})\frac{1 + \text{Expected Inflation}_{Currency}}{1 + \text{Expected Inflation}_{US\$}} - 1\]</span> Thus, if the US dollar risk free rate is 2.00%, the inflation rate in the foreign currency is 15% and the inflation rate in US dollar is 1.5%, the foreign currency risk free rate is: <span class="math display">\[\text{Riskfree Rate} = 1.02\frac{1.15}{1.015} = 15.57\%\]</span></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="discount-rates-ii-the-equity-risk-premium">Discount Rates II: The Equity Risk Premium</h2>
<h3 id="simplest-way-the-country-default-spread">Simplest Way: The Country Default Spread</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Default spread for country</strong>: In this approach, the country equity risk premium is set equal to the default spread for the country, estimated in one of three ways:
<ul>
<li>The default spread on a dollar denominated bond issued by the country. (In January 2019, that spread was the yield for the Brazilian US dollar bond) was 1.30%.</li>
<li>The sovereign CDS spread for the country. In January 2019, the ten year CDS spread for Brazil, adjusted for the US CDS, was 2.57%.</li>
<li>The default spread based on the local currency rating for the country. Brazil’s sovereign local currency rating is Ba2 and the default spread for a Ba2 rated sovereign was about 3.39% in January 2019.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Add the default spread to a “mature” market premium: This default spread is added on to the mature market premium to arrive at the total equity risk premium for Brazil, assuming a mature market premium of 5.96%.
<ul>
<li>Country Risk Premium for Brazil = 3.39% (Using the Ba2 CDS)</li>
<li>Total ERP for Brazil = 5.96% + 3.39% = 9.35%</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="an-equity-volatility-based-approach">An Equity Volatility Based Approach</h3>
<p>This approach drwas on the standard deviation of two equity markets, the emerging market in question and a base market (usually the US). The total equity risk premium (ERP) for the emerging markte is then written as: <span class="math display">\[\text{Total ERP} = \text{Risk Premium}_{\text{US}}\times\frac{\sigma_{\text{Country Equity}}}{\sigma_{\text{US Equity}}}\]</span></p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Assume the ERP for the US is 5.69%</li>
<li>Assume the standard deviation in the Bovespa (Brazilian equity) is 30% and the standard deviation for the S&amp;P 500 (US equity) is 18%.</li>
<li>Total ERP for Brazil <span class="math inline">\(= 5.95\%\times\frac{30\%}{18\%}=9.93\%\)</span></li>
<li>Country equity risk premium for Brazil <span class="math inline">\(= 9.93\%-5.96\%=3.97\%\)</span></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="a-melded-approach-to-estimating-the-additional-country-erp">A Melded Approach to Estimating the Additional Country ERP</h3>
<p>Country ratings measure default resk. While default risk permiums and equity risk premiums are highly correlated, one would expect equity spreads to be higher than debt spreads.</p>
<p>Hence, a practice is to multiply the bond default spread by the relative volatility of stock and bond prices in that market. Using this approach for Brazil in January 2019, we would get:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\text{Country ERP} = \text{Default spread on country bond}\times\frac{\sigma_\text{Country Equity}}{\sigma_\text{Country Bond}}\)</span>
<ul>
<li>Standard Deviation in Bovespa <span class="math inline">\(= 30\%\)</span></li>
<li>Standard Deviation in Brazil government bond <span class="math inline">\(= 20\%\)</span></li>
<li>Default spread for Brazil <span class="math inline">\(= 3.39\%\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Brazil Country Euqity Risk Premium <span class="math inline">\(= 3.39\%\times\frac{30\%}{20\%} = 5.09\%\)</span></li>
<li>Brazil Total ERP <span class="math inline">\(=\)</span> Mature Market Premium + CRP <span class="math inline">\(= 5.96\% + 5.09\% = 11.05\%\)</span></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Location-based CRP</strong>: The standard approach in valuation is to attach a country risk premium to a company based on its country of incorporation. Thus, if you are an Indian company, you are assumed to be exposed to the Indian country risk premium. A developed market company is assumed to be unexposed to emerging market risk.</li>
<li><strong>Operation-based CRP</strong>: This is a more reasonable modified version. The country risk premium for a company can be computed as a weighted average of the country risk premiums fo the countries that it does business in, with the weights based on revenues or operating income. If a company is exposed to risk in dozens of countries, you can take a weighted average of the risk premiums by region.</li>

<h4 id="problems-with-these-approaches">Problems with these approaches</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus just on revenues</strong>: To the extent that revenues are the only variable that you consider, when weighting risk exposure across markets, you may be missing other exposures to country risk. For instance, an emerging market company that gets the bulk of its revenues outside the country (in a developed market) may still have all of its production facilities in the emerging market.</li>
<li><strong>Exposure not adjusted or based upon beta</strong>: To the extent that the country risk premium is multiplied by a beta, we are assuming that beta in addition to measuring exposure to all other macro economic risk also measures exposure to country risk.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="approach-3-estimate-a-lambda-for-country-risk">Approach 3: Estimate a lambda for country risk</h4>
<p>Country risk exposure is affected by where you get your revenues and where your production happens, but there are a host of other variables that also affect this exposure, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of risk management products: Companies can use both options/futures markets and insurance to hedge some or a significant portion of country risk.</li>
<li>Government "national" interests: There are sectores that are vieewed as vital to the national interests, and governments oftern play a key role in these companies, either officially or unofficially. These sectores are more exposed to country risk.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is conceivable that there is a richer mersure of country risk that incorporated all of the variables that drive country risk in one measure. That is "lambda" by A.</p>
<h4 id="a-revenue-based-lambda">A revenue-based lambda</h4>
<p>The factor <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> measures the relative exposure of a firm to country risk. One simplistic solution would be to fo the following: <span class="math display">\[ \lambda = \frac{\text{\% of revenues domestically}_{firm}}{\text{\% of revenues domecstically}_{average\ firm}} \]</span></p>
<p>Consider two firms - Tata Motors and Tata Consulting Services, both Indian companies. In 2008-2009, Tata Motors got about 91.37% of its revenues in India and TCS got 7.62%. The average Indian firm gets about 80% of tis revenues in India:<br>
<span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{TM} = \frac{91\%}{80\%} = 1.14\)</span><br>
<span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{TCS} = \frac{7.62\%}{80\%} = 0.09\)</span></p>
<p>There are two implications</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A company's risk exposure is determined by where it does business and not by where it is incorporated.</li>
<li>Firms might be able to actively manage their country risk exposures.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="the-capm-beta-the-most-used-yet-misused-risk-measure">The CAPM Beta: The Most Used (yet Misused) Risk Measure</h3>
<p>The standard procedure for estimating betas is to regress stock returns <span class="math inline">\(R_j\)</span> against market return <span class="math inline">\(R_m\)</span><br>
<span class="math display">\[ R_j = a + bR_m \]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is the intercept and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the slope of the regression</p>
<p>The slope fo the regression corresponds to the beta of the stock, and measuresthe riskiness of the stock.</p>
<p>This beta has three problems:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It has high standard error.</li>
<li>It reflects the firm's business mix over the period of the regression, not the current mix.</li>
<li>It reflects the firm's average finanical leverage over the period rater than the current leverage.</li>

<h3 id="adjusting-for-financial-leverage">Adjusting for financial leverage</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conventional approach</strong>: If we assume that debt carries no market risk (has a beta of zero), the beta of equity alone can be written as a function of the unlevered beta and the debt-equity ratio<br>
<span class="math inline">\(\beta_L = \beta_U(1 + (1-t)\frac{D}{E})\)</span><br>
In some versions, the tax effect is ignored and there is no (1-t) in the eqution</li>
<li><strong>Debt adjusted approach</strong>: If beta carries market risk and you can estimate the beta of debt, you can estimate the levered beta as follows<br>
<span class="math inline">\(\beta_L = \beta_U(1 + (1-t)\frac{D}{E}) - \beta_{debt}(1-t)\frac{D}{E}\)</span><br>
While the latter is more realistic, estimating betas for debt can be difficult to do.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-bottom-up-betas">Why Bottom-up Betas?</h3>
<p>The standard error in a bottom-up beta will be significantly lower than the standard error in a single regression beta. Roughly speaking, the standard error of a bottom-upbeta estimate can be written as follows: <span class="math display">\[ \text{Std error of bottom-up beta} = \frac{\text{Average Std Error  across Betas}}{\sqrt{\text{Number of Firms in Sample}}}\]</span></p>
<p>The bottom-up beta can be adjusted to reflect changes in the firm's business mix and financial leverage. Regression betas reflect the past.</p>
<p>You can estimate bottom-up betas even when you do not have histocial stock prices. This is the case with initial public offerings, private businesses or divisions of companies.</p>

<h3 id="estimating-the-cost-of-debt">Estimating the Cost of Debt</h3>
<p>The cost of debt is the rate at which the company can borrow at currently. It will reflect not only the default risk but also the level of interest rates in the market.</p>
<p>The two most widely used approaches to estimating cost of debt are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Looking up the yield to maturity on a straight bond outstanding from the firm. The limitation of this approach is that very few firms have long term straight bonds that are liquid and widely traded.</li>
<li>Looking up the rating for the firm and estimating a default spread based upon the rating. While this approach is more robust, different bonds from the same firm can have different ratings. You have to use a median rating for the firm.</li>
</ol>
<p>When in trouble (either because you have no ratings or multiple ratings for a firm), estimate a synthetic rating for your firm and the cost of debt based upon that rating.</p>
<h3 id="estimating-synthetic-ratings">Estimating Synthetic Ratings</h3>
<p>The rating for a frim can be estimated using the financial characteristics of the firm. In its simplest form, the rating can be esttimated from the interest coverage ratio <span class="math display">\[ \text{Interest Coverage Ratio} = \frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{Interest Expenses}} \]</span></p>
<h3 id="cost-of-debt-computations">Cost of Debt Computations</h3>
<p>Companies in countries with low bond ratings and high default risk might bear the burden of country defult risk, especially if they are smaller or have all of their revenues within the country.</p>
<p>Larger companies that derive a significant portion of their revenues in global markets may be less exposed to country default risk. In other words, they may be able to borrow at a rate lower than the government.</p>
<p>The synthetic rating for Embraer is A-. Using the 2004 default spread of 1.00%, we estimate a cost of debt of 9.29% (using a risk free rate of 4.29% and adding in two thirds of the country default spread of 6.01%):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
    \text{Cost of debt} &amp;= \text{Risk free rate} + \frac{2}{3}(\text{Brazil country default spread}) + \text{Company default spread} \\
    &amp;=4.29\%+4.00\%+1.00\% \\
    &amp;=9.29\%
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<h3 id="synthetic-ratings-some-caveats">Synthetic Ratings: Some Caveats</h3>
<p>The relationship between interest coverage ratios and ratings, developed using US companies, tends to travel well, as long as we are analyzing large manufacturing firms in markets with interest rates close to the US interest rate.</p>
<p>They are more problematic when looking at smaller companies in markets with higher interest rates than the US. One way to adjust for this difference is modify the interest coverage ratio table to reflect interest rate differences (For instances, if interest rates in an emerging market are twice as high as rates in the US, halve the interest coverage ratio.</p>
<h3 id="converting-a-dollar-cost-of-capital-to-a-nominal-real-cost-of-capital">Converting a Dollar Cost of Capital to a Nominal Real Cost of Capital</h3>
<h4 id="approach-1">Approach 1</h4>
<p>Use a BR risk free rate in all of the calculations above. For instance, if the BR risk fre rate was 12%, the cost of capital would be computed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost of Equity: <span class="math inline">\(12\% + 1.07(4\%) + 0.27(7.89\%) = 18.41\%\)</span></li>
<li>Cost of Debt: <span class="math inline">\(12\% + 1\% = 13\%\)</span></li>
<li>This assumes the risk free rate has no country risk premium embedded in it.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="approach-2">Approach 2</h4>
<p>Use the differential inflation rate to estimate the cost of capital. For instance, if the inflation rate in BR is 8% and the inflation rate in the U.S. is 2%.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \begin{align*}
    \text{Cost of Capital} &amp;= (1+\text{Cost of Capital}_{\text{US}})\frac{1+\text{Inflation}_{\text{BR}}}{1+\text{Inflation}_\text{US}} - 1\\
    &amp;= 1.0997\frac{1.08}{1.02} - 1 \\
    &amp;= 0.1644 = 16.44\%
\end{align*} \]</span></p>
<h3 id="dealing-with-hybrids-and-preferred-stock">Dealing with Hybrids and Preferred Stock</h3>
<p>When dealing with hybrids (convertible bonds, for instance), break down the security into debt and equity and alllocate the amounts accordingly. Thus, if a firm has <code>$125</code> million in convertible debt outstanding, break the <code>$125</code> million into straight debt and conversion option components. The conversion option is equity.</p>
<p>When dealing with preferred stock, it is better to keep it as a separate component. The cost of preferred stock is the preferred divident yield. (As a rule of thumb, if the preferred stock is less than 5% of the outstanding market value of the firm, lumping it in with debt will make no significant impact on your valuation).</p>
<h3 id="decomposing-a-convertible-bond">Decomposing a Convertible bond</h3>
<p>Assume that the firm that you are analyzing has <code>$125</code> million in face value of convertible debt with a stated interest rate of 4%, a 10 year maturity and a market value of <code>$140</code> million. If the firm has a bond rating of A and the interest rate on Arated straight bond is 8%, you can break down the value of the convertible bond into straight debt and equity portions.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\text{Straight debt} = (4\% \times 125)a_{n=10,i=8\%} + 125\times 1.08^{10} = 91.45\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\text{Equity portion} = 140 - 91.45 = 48.55\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The debt portion added to debt and the option portion addd to the market cap to get the debt and equity weights in the cost of capital.</p>
